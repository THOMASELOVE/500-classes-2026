## Announcements

1. Remember that we don't have class next week, thanks to CWRU Spring Break. Our next class (Class 8) will be held on 2026-03-19.
2. A key item we'll be using today is [this tool from Paul Rosenbaum](https://rosenbap.shinyapps.io/learnsenShiny/), about sensitivity analysis.
3. Don't forget about the **schedule for OSIA sessions**, which begin in Class 9.
4. First look comments from me on your [Project Proposals](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2026/proj500.html) should be available **by class time**.
5. [Lab 3](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2026/lab3.html) is due to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) on Tuesday 2026-03-17 at noon.
6. For next time, be sure to read Rosenbaum *Causal Inference* through Chapter 7 (Natural Experiments, Discontinuities and Instruments) as well as the other sources listed below (read Whitehouse, skim Landrum & Ayanian and skim Tanenbaum)
