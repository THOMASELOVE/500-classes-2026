## Announcements

1. Remember to email me [your OSIA selections](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2026/osia.html) by noon on Tuesday 2026-02-10. Current selections [are posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-classes-2026/tree/main/osia).
2. Today's class will include a discussion of Chapter 5 (Sensitivity to Unmeasured Covariates) from Rosenbaum's *Causal Inference*.
3. Prior to our next class, be sure to read Rosenbaum Chapter 6 (Quasi-Experimental Devices) and skim [Austin (2014)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Austin%202014%20Comparing%2012%20PS%20matching%20algorithms.pdf) and [Ahmed MI (2012)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-sources/blob/main/articles/Ahmed%20et%20al%202012%20Int%20J%20Card.pdf)
4. At our next class, we will spend meaningful time with both [the lindner example](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-examples/#the-lindner-example) and [the dm2200 example](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-examples/#the-dm2200-example).
5. It would be very wise to have your Project Data ingested into R by class time next week (2026-02-12).
6. [Lab 2](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2026/lab2.html) is due 2026-02-24.

## Three Focal Points from Rosenbaum Chapter 5 (Sensitivity to Unmeasured Covariates) for your consideration

- How should one strike the right balance between scientific evidence and criticism of scientific evidence?
- Quantifying the bias needed to explain an association between a treatment and an outcome that is seen in the data is an important advance.
- Sensitivity analysis can either be "a shield against frivolous conterclaims," or it can reveal a claim to be "highly dependent on dubious assumptions."

### Our Usual Three Questions for Discussion as a Small Group

1. What was the most important thing you learned from reading Chapter 4?
2. What was the muddiest, least clear thing that arose in your reading?
3. What questions are at the front of your mind now?
