2. An answer sketch for [Lab 2] will be posted to our Shared Drive **by class time**.
3. Your [Project Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/500-2026/proj500.html) is due to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) at noon on Tuesday 2026-03-03.
    - I will summarize proposals [here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-classes-2026/blob/main/project/README.md), as they come in.
4. A reminder that a key item I'd like you to look at before Class 7 next week is [this tool from Paul Rosenbaum](https://rosenbap.shinyapps.io/learnsenShiny/), about sensitivity analysis.

## Three Focal Points from Rosenbaum Chapter 6 (Quasi-Experimental Device) for your consideration

- What is a quasi-experimental device?
    - A quasi-experimental device strengthens a causal claim using data that weakens some anticipated counter-claim.
- Why consider having two control groups?
    - If two control groups have similar outcomes despite great differences in terms of some unmeasured covariate, that tends to undermine a claim that the treated and control groups have different outcomes because of a failure to control for that covariate.
- Correct explanations are found by eliminating mistaken explanations, one at a time.
    - "When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." (Arthur Conan Doyle)

### Our Usual Three Questions for Discussion as a Small Group

1. What was the most important thing you learned from reading Chapter 5?
2. What was the muddiest, least clear thing that arose in your reading?
3. What questions are at the front of your mind now?
